# Question 1
# You all are Pilots, you want to land a plane safely, so altitude required for landing a plane is
# 1000ft, it it is less than tell pilot to land the plane, or it is more than that but less than 5000ft ask
# the pilot to “come down to 1000ft”, else if it more than 5000ft ask the pilot to “go around and try
# later”
# num=int(input("Enter Number:"))
# if num<1000:
#     print("Land The Plane")
# elif num==1000:
#     print("Safe To Land")
# elif num==4500:
#     print("Bring Down To 1000")
# elif num==6500:
#     print("Turn Around")
# else:
#     pass

# Question 2
# Using for loop please print all the prime numbers between 1- 200 using FOR LOOP AND RANGE
# function.
